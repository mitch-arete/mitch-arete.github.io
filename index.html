    			<p>Aret&eacute; Capital is an investment firm based in Austin, Texas with one core objective: maximize wealth creation. Fund decisions are always made with this fundamental objective in mind. The fund aims to generate absolute returns that are uncorrelated with long-term market conditions. Please contact <a href="mailto:mitch@arete-cap.com">mitch@arete-cap.com</a> for more information.</p>
    			<p>The business targets long-only small cap stocks and liquid high yield bonds. Our work and process is research-backed and thesis-driven. We pursue rational investments in favorable situations that are poised for long-term success. Rather than force ourselves into unattractive investments, we prefer to wait for situations that check all of our long-term criteria. As a result, the portfolio is concentrated and contains high conviction, long-term investments.</p>
    			<p>The fund aligns with businesses that are poised to produce resilient and growing free cash flow over the long-term. Investing in quality, growing businesses at attractive valuations is a natural hedge to capital impairment. The portfolio maintains a growth orientation which helps drive long-term outperformance and upside.</p>
